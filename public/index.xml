      <description>My name is Tom Mackay and I am The MadBiker and before I shall write anything else I shall answer the obvious question, why did I choose that name to call my online self?&#xA;When I informed those that knew me that I was giving up a well paid job, selling or giving away all of my worldly possessions, and leaving behind a comfortable lifestyle to travel the word on a bike, a lot of people told me that I was Mad!</description>
